# Recipe: VMOST Mission Board

## About

The VMOST framework is a rapid way that stakeholders can gain a high level understanding of desired changes in the context of how they fit in with the strategic and long term vision of the business.

The framework links both the desired  destination (the vision) with the changes (the tactics). 

This ensures that all investment focuses on value and taking the business forward in the correct direction. 

The framework also highlights where additional changes may be need to be identified in order to achieve some of the objectives.

### Preparing the team

The quality of your VMOST Mission Board will reflect the quality of the effort and thought put into it.  Prior to the session as participants three simple questions:   

- What they need to achieve over the next 12-18 months?
- What are the drivers that make the above important?
- What measurable outcomes do we want to achieve from the above?

## Instructions

### 1. Brainstorming

- Execution time - 1-2 Hours
1. Hand out Sticky Notes or Index Cards and pens to all participants
1. Ask each person to begin writing things they want to achieve, do, deliver over the next 12-18 months
1. Ask them to add each item to the board (in no specific place or order), giving a brief summary of the item
1. Iterate around step 4 until discussions and ideas are exhausted

### 2. Refinement

- Execution time: 2-4 Hours
1. Look for affinity groups, where items are similar or share a theme, these could become Missions or Strategies.  If you have more than 4 Missions, consider grouping some, ideally you should have between 3 and 4 Missions.
1. Look for objective measures (e.g.; double revenue within 12 months, hire x more UX people by Christmas, etc.), these are likely to be objectives
1. For each affinity group, consider groups as missions, give each a title
1. Discuss for each mission, which items are Strategies (likely to be achieved by a group of activities or Tactics) or a Tactic (a single deliverable milestone)


### 3. Reflection

- Execution time: 2-4 Hours
1. Look for gaps:
    - Tactics or Strategies not aligned to Objectives
    - Vague Objectives, all Objectives should be SMART
        - S - Specific, Significant, Stretching
        - M - Measurable, Meaningful, Motivational
        - A - agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented
        - R - realistic, relevant, reasonable, rewarding, results-oriented
        - T - time-based, time-bound, timely, tangible, trackable
    - Missing Strategies
    - Strategies with little or no Tactics
1. Create a Vision Statement
    - This should be a single sentence with bold ambition.  **BHAG** (Big Hairy Audacious Goal)

### 4. Reality

- Execution time: 1-4 Days
1. Estimate the benefits and effort for each Tactic
1. Match to capacity and capability to deliver (recommend a Near, Far, Further Plan)
1. Prioritise Missions - how much effort or capacity will you award to each
1. Prioritise Strategies
1. Prioritise Tactics
1. Set realistic goals and draw a line under the last Tactic per Mission you hope to deliver within the next planning cycle
1. Revisit the VMOST Mission Board at least every quarter year

## Serving Suggestions

VMOST Mission Boards are excellent visualisations of what you are aiming to do and why.  Share them and post them around your offices, your Intranet, your teams.

If you have geographically distributed teams, consider using a visualisation tool to provide a more readable and shareable version.
