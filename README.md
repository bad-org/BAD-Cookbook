# BAD Cookbook

Welcome to the BAD (Blended Agile Delivery) Cookbook.

This is a selection of meals, courses and recipes to help organisations adapt and deliver in a structured, disciplined, Agile and Lean way.

This is an open-source framework, and all are welcome to contribute.  We have used GitHub as our master repository and write in MarkDown file format to allow maximum flexibility for publishing content

## Why Cookbooks, Meals, Courses and Recipes

We see ourselves as chefs and we use recipes created by ourselves or others to help our organisations.  What are Meals, Courses and Recipes?

- **Meals** - are complete sets of courses to solve common problems
- **Courses** - are a set of recipes to solve problem areas of your organisation
- **Recipes** are experiments to try to satisfy a specific challenge or problem.
